1. Find the IP camera address (ex.: http://192.168.2.17:80/) from the app. For AOBO I found it from P2PLiveCam app.

2. Enter the IP address in browser with Developer Tools window enabled.

3. Find the IP address that gets stream from camera and use it in the code.
stream = cv2.VideoCapture('http://admin:@192.168.2.17:80/media/?action=stream')
