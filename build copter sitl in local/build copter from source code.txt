
FOR RUNNING COPTER 3.7 following was done
1. Installed cywin64
2. Set up Eclipse to build waf file
	Eclipse project location: C:\cygwin64\home\santoshkumar\ardupilot

cd C:\Program Files Self\MAVProxy
mavproxy.exe --master tcp:127.0.0.1:5760 --out 127.0.0.1:1450


open CYGWIN64 terminal and navigate to ArduCopter folder
Copter version 3.3 is installed by default with Cygwin in C:\cygwin64\home\santoshkumar\ardupilot\ArduCopter

I built latest Copter 3.7 into following location:
cd C:\cygwin64\home\santoshkumar\ardupilot\build\fmuv3\ArduCopter

Run this command:
cd ~/ardupilot/ArduCopter
sim_vehicle.py -N
sim_vehicle.py --map --console -N
-N ensures it is not built every time SITL is launched
--map is not needed coz mision planner will be connected and used
Note: build directory is: /home/santoshkumar/ardupilot/build/sitl
